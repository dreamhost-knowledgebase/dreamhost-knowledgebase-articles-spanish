<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard">Payment Card Industry</a> (PCI) compliance is an information security standard for all organizations that store, process, or transmit credit card data.</p>
<p>DreamHost is PCI compliant. However, this only applies to DreamHost's own sites and servers. DreamHost's PCI compliance does not cover customer websites.</p>
<h2>How do I make my site PCI compliant?</h2>
<p>Every customer must obtain their own PCI certification if they need it for their site (e.g., if the site processes credit card information).</p>
<p>You should first contact your payment processor for information on how to become PCI compliant. They will be able to give you detailed information on the process and point you to an Approved Scanning Vendor.</p>
