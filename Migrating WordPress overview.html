<p>Migrating a WordPress site is different from migrating a simple HTML website because WordPress sites depend on both web files as well as a MySQL database to run. This overview explains your options depending on the type of migration you need.</p>
<h2>Migrating a WordPress site from a different host</h2>
<p>If you are migrating a WordPress site from a different hosting company (host), there are many different options available to you. Here are some of the more popular methods from which you can choose:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214693178-How-to-manually-migrate-WordPress-to-DreamHost">Migrating your site manually using FTP and phpMyAdmin</a></li>
<li>Migrating your site using a third-party WordPress plugin, such as <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215412197-Migrating-WordPress-to-DreamHost-using-the-Duplicator-plugin">Duplicator</a></li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#paid">Requesting DreamHost Professional Services to migrate your site for a fee</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Each method’s steps may change depending on whether you are keeping the same domain name (aka your URL) or you are changing to a new one.</p>
<h3>Keeping the same domain name</h3>
<p>If you are keeping the same domain name and you want to minimize downtime on the current site while you are migrating, you might benefit from setting up a mirror of your DreamHost site using a temporary <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002284771-What-is-a-dreamhosters-com-subdomain-">.dreamhosters.com subdomain</a>:</p>

</ul>
<h3>Changing the domain name</h3>
<p>If you are changing your WordPress site to a new domain name when you move to DreamHost, you could use a plugin. Many plugins help you make that change automatically, though each plugin handles it in its own way.</p>
<p>If you choose not to use a plugin and migrate manually using <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> and <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214395638-phpMyAdmin-overview">phpMyAdmin</a>, you must manually update your migrated site to the new domain name. After you complete the five steps in the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214693178-How-to-manually-migrate-WordPress-to-DreamHost">Migrating Manually instructions</a>, the following guide’s steps 5 through 7 help you rename your WordPress site manually:</p>
