<p>Google requires domain ownership verification for some of the services they offer. If you have registered your domain with DreamHost or manage DNS with DreamHost, there are several options that Google provides to verify your domain name with them.</p>
<h2><span id="How_can_I_verify_my_domain_with_Google.3F">How can I verify my domain with Google?</span></h2>
<p>As of March 1, 2015, Google offers four different options to verify your domain with them. The methods below are all taken from Google’s documentation on domain verification:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add a meta tag to your homepage (proving that you have access to the source files). To use this method, you must be able to edit the HTML code of your site's pages.</li>
<li>Upload a Google HTML file to your server. To use this method, you must be able to upload new files to your server.</li>
<li>Verify via your domain name provider. To use this method, you must be able to sign in to your domain name provider (for example: DreamHost) and add a new DNS record.</li>
<li>Add the Google Analytics code you use to track your site. To use this option, you must be an administrator on the Google Analytics account, and the tracking code must use the new asynchronous snippet.</li>
</ol>

<h3><span id="Method_1:_Adding_a_meta_tag_to_your_homepage">Method 1: Adding a meta tag to your homepage</span></h3>
<p>This method requires that you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a line of code to your site files, and is a moderately advanced method of verifying your domain.</li>
<li>Sign up for a hosting plan on your DreamHost account.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you retrieve this line of code from Google’s Webmaster Tools panel, manually edit your current website code by adding Google's line of code to it in order to use this method of verification.</p>

<p>This method requires that you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign up for a hosting plan on your DreamHost account.</li>
<li>Download an HTML file from Google’s Webmaster Tools panel, and upload it via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> to your DreamHost server.</li>
<li>Manually upload this file.</li>

<h3><span id="Method_3:_Verifying_via_your_domain_name_provider">Method 3: Verifying via your domain name provider</span></h3>
<p>This method requires that your domain is using DreamHost’s <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview">nameservers</a>, but you do not need to have an active hosting plan to verify your domain using this method.</p>
<p>Google will provide you with the option of using a <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/183895">TXT</a> or <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/47283">CNAME</a> record to add to your domain in your DreamHost panel. Using the TXT record is the simplest option in this case.</p>
<p>The TXT record looks similar to “<strong>google-site-verification=1234-abcd-5678-EFGH</strong>”. Follow these steps to add this record to your domain in your panel:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘Manage Domains’</a>) page.</li>
<li>Find your domain name on this page, and then click the ‘DNS’ link directly under the domain name.
<dl>
<dd><em>When the 'Add a custom DNS record...' page opens, enter your TXT verification code:</em></dd>

</dl>
</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Add Record Now!</strong> button to save this TXT record.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also verify using a CNAME record, however it's slightly more advanced. Google will provide you with two items if you choose the CNAME verification option:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CNAME Label / Host:</strong> 1234abcd.example.com (example)</li>
<li><strong>CNAME Destination / Target:</strong> ab-cdefghijk.dv.googlehosted.com (example)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose to use the CNAME record to verify instead, your custom DNS record in your panel is entered a bit differently:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/02_Google_Site_Verification_add_cname_record.fw.png" alt="02 Google Site Verification add cname record.fw.png" width="536" height="195" /></dd>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>Once you add a TXT or CNAME record, it can take up to 72 hours for Google to verify the new DNS record in their system. Google also recommends that you leave this record on the domain, even after it has been verified.</p>
