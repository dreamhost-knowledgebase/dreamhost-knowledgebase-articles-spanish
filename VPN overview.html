<p>A Virtual Private Network (VPN) can be thought of as a private and encrypted network within a public network.</p>
<p>Common examples/uses include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessing a company network while away from the office</li>
<li>Circumventing <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/217213057-China-Firewall-overview">internet censorship</a></li>
<li>Protecting yourself on a public Wi-Fi network such as a coffee shop or airport</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few basic examples of what VPNs can be used for. Creating a VPN can be a very complicated task depending on how you would like to implement the service.</p>
<h2>VPNs and DreamHost</h2>
<p>DreamHost does not offer any VPN service. If you wish to create a VPN at DreamHost, the only option is to purchase a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215279658-Dedicated-server-overview">Dedicated server</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214840947-What-is-DreamCompute-">DreamCompute</a>. Since you have sudo/root access on these types of servers, you can install any VPN software you like.</p>
<p>Please note that this would need to be completely custom built by you. DreamHost support can not assist in any way with the configuration of your VPN.</p>
