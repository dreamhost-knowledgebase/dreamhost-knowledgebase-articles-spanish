<p>Adding an SSL certificate to your WordPress site is an excellent first step towards securing your data. However, there are a few other steps you must take to fully ensure all links within your site point to the secure version of your domain name (This means the 'HTTPS' version).</p>
<h2>Add an SSL certificate to the domain</h2>
<p>Make sure your site is properly set up for HTTPS. You need to have an <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041537-Secure-Hosting-overview">SSL certificate</a> applied to your site and possibly a Unique IP address depending on your requirements for the site. See the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216109647-Unique-IP-overview">Unique IP</a> article for more information.</p>
<h2>Update the Home and Site URL in WordPress</h2>
<ol>
<li>Log into WordPress using the new secure HTTPS URL.
<ul>
<li><strong>https://example.com/wp-login.php</strong></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/2018-05-02_wordpress_ssl_01.png" alt="&quot;" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Navigate to Settings -&gt; General page.
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/WordPress_https.png" alt="" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>On the General page, <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214580498-How-do-I-change-the-WordPress-Site-URL-">change the URLs</a> to add the '<strong>s</strong>' in 'HTTPS'.</li>
<li>Scroll down and click the <strong>Save Changes</strong> button.
<div class="alert alert-note">

<div class="alert-content">
<p>When you click <strong>Save Changes</strong>, WordPress will log you out.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Update your wp-config.php file</h2>
<ol>
<li>Log into your webserver via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027#FTP_security">SFTP</a>.</li>
<li>Find the file named 'wp-config.php' in your WordPress site directory, and <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006413028-Creating-and-editing-a-file-via-SSH">then open it in a text editor</a>.</li>
<li>​Add the following two lines above the line that​ says <strong>/* That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */</strong>:
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">define('FORCE_SSL', true);
define('FORCE_SSL_ADMIN',true);
</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Force the URL to redirect to HTTPS</h2>
<p>You can force your site to redirect from HTTP to HTTPS in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215747758#Forcing_HTTPS_with_WordPress">Update rules in your site's .htaccess file</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-https/">Use a WordPress HTTPS plugin</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Update database URLs</h2>
<h3>If this is a new WordPress site</h3>
<p>If this is a brand new site, all new pages and posts you create will be saved with the HTTPS URL, so no further changes are required.</p>
<h3>If this is an existing WordPress site with content</h3>
<p>If this is an existing site with existing images, posts, and pages, you must also change all internal URLs to use the new secure URL. View the following article for instructions on how to do this with a plugin:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003300591-Changing-your-WordPress-database-URLs-to-https-using-a-plugin">Changing your WordPress database URLs to https using a plugin</a></li>
</ul>
