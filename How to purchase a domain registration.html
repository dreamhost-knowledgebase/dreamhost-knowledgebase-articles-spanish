<h2>Controlling DNS for the registration</h2>
<p>After logging into your panel, you can see the domain registration is set to DNS Only. This means you have control over where the DNS records are pointed. </p>
<p>By default they are set to DreamHost. If you wish to point them to another hosting company you can either create custom DNS records or update the nameservers. View the following articles for details:</p>

</ul>
<h2>Deleting a registration you just purchased</h2>
<p>It’s possible to delete a domain registration within 5 days of purchase. This is often necessary if it was misspelled. However this time period is not available for certain TLDs. Depending on the TLD you purchased, it’s possible there is no grace period at all. <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215722447-Contacting-DreamHost-via-email">Contact support</a> immediately if you wish to reverse your recent purchase.</p>
