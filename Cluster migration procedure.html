<p>Beginning June 21, 2018, DreamHost will begin migrating existing DreamObjects accounts to a new and improved cluster. This will help with the long term stability of your data.</p>
<h2>What will happen to my current data?</h2>
<p>Your data will continue to exist and function normally until October 1, 2018, after which the old cluster will be shut down.</p>
<p>Due to several technical incompatibilities, it's not possible to automatically migrate your data to the new cluster. However, please note that you have until October to migrate your data to the new cluster.</p>
<p>The 'Migration tool' described below contains step-by-step instructions on migrating your data using the DreamHost panel.</p>
<div class="alert alert-important">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://kbimages.objects-us-west-1.dream.io/images/dh-kb-important-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>You will not be able to add any new data to the old buckets on the old cluster. If you regularly add data to your buckets, you must migrate the data as soon as possible to the new buckets so you can continue your data upload processes without interruption.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>What will happen if I'm still using a Legacy CDN name?</h2>
<p>DreamObjects CDN names are no longer supported at DreamHost. If you are currently using a 'Legacy' CDN name that is still functional, you must use the new cluster's hostname <strong>objects-us-east-1.dream.io</strong> after you migrate your data to the new cluster.</p>
<p>You can also create a new <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215253408-How-to-create-a-DNS-alias-for-DreamObjects-buckets">subdomain alias</a>.</p>
<h2>Migration tool</h2>
<p>You might be familiar with the earlier version of this tool from the article <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001860231-Migrating-3rd-party-S3-buckets-to-DreamObjects">Migrating 3rd party S3 buckets to DreamObjects</a>.</p>
<p>The migration interface has been improved to allow you to select a DreamObjects user as the source for a copy, as well as the destination for a copy. You do not need to specify the Access Key or Secret Key for the source user, as they are copied internally in the migration tool after a source user is selected.</p>
<h2>Tool limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>The destination bucket MUST NOT contain any files.</li>
<li>Bucket &amp; Object ACLs:
<ul>
<li>This includes public-read/<em>AllUsers</em>, as well as <em>AuthenticatedUsers</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<ul>
<li>Single-owner ACLs are preserved</li>
<li>Support for Group ACLs <span style="font-weight: 400;">and Complex ACLs is in progress, but not available at this time.</span></li>
</ul>
<li>CORS:</li>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The migration tool does not currently support the transfer of bucket-specific CORS policies. If you are using CORS on your bucket, please note any CORS setting you may have on buckets in objects-us-west-1 and then apply those setting to the migrated bucket on objects-us-east-1.</span></li>
</ul>
<li>Static Website:</li>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The migration tool does not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">currently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> support the transfer of of any static sites you may have set up in objects-us-west-1 to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">objects-us-east-1. Please reconfigure your buckets with static site(s) once the transfer is complete.</span></li>
</ul>
<li>Server-Side Encryption (SSE)</li>
<ul>
<li>AWS SSE is not officially supported, but SSE-C is available</li>
<li>If you use SSE-C, you will NOT be able to use the migration tool because it does not have access to your encryption key</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>A source bucket with data</li>
<li>A destination bucket name (or an empty bucket)</li>
</ul>

<li>If any of the bucket names you have chosen conflict with a bucket name in the destination cluster, the Bucket Conflict page appears before the Migration can start.</li>
<li>A bucket conflict means that the name of bucket from the source cluster already exists in the destination cluster, and that the bucket in the destination cluster is not empty (nothing will be overwritten).</li>

<li>When a migration completes, the panel shows the status as 'Complete' and it is moved to the 'Completed Migrations' section. An email confirmation is also sent to the primary email address of your DreamHost account. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Using the new hostname after the migration</h2>
<p>Once you have migrated your data to a bucket on the new cluster, you can start using the new bucket immediately.</p>
<p>If you use URLs or hostnames to provide public/website access to the objects in your buckets, you must change them from the old hostname (objects-us-west-1.dream.io) to the new hostname, <strong>objects-us-east-1.dream.io</strong>.</p>
<p>If you use a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215253408-How-to-create-a-DNS-alias-for-DreamObjects-buckets">subdomain alias</a> on the old cluster, make sure to add the alias to the new bucket to keep using it as the hostname.</p>
