<p>In an effort to improve the speed and reliability of your email service, DreamHost is upgrading customer email accounts to new, faster hardware in its state-of-the-art data center. </p>
<p>To boost the safety and security of your email, SSL is now enabled by default for connections to DreamHost’s mail servers.</p>

<p>Please note that there are a few changes you should be aware of if you are using vanity mail server URLs. View the <a class="reference internal" href="#vanity">section below</a> for further details.</p>

<h2><span id="potential">Potential issues</span></h2>
<h3>Duplicate emails during the migration process</h3>
<p>You’ll continue to have access to your email accounts during migration, but please refrain from making any changes within your accounts until maintenance wraps up. Moving emails between folders, deleting messages, and even modifying “message-read” flags may cause those messages to duplicate at the new location during the cleanup synchronization. Rest assured, you will not lose any emails as a result of this migration.</p>
<h3>DNS propagation issues</h3>
<p>Incoming messages may be delayed as the new servers’ DNS records propagate across the Internet. Some messages may even <em>temporarily</em> appear to go missing on the new server. Don’t panic if this happens—they will return!</p>
<h3>Time frame</h3>
<p>As mailbox sizes can vary, your migration can take anywhere from one hour to one week. Keep an eye out for the completion notice that DreamHost sends once your entire account has finished migrating.</p>
<h3>Do not add or remove users during the migration</h3>
<p>Once you've received the email that DreamHost has begun your migration, please do not add or remove any email users until you've received the completion notice that the migration has completed. This can result in your users being split across two different mail clusters, as well as breaking important settings on your account.</p>
<h2><span id="suggested">Suggested changes</span></h2>

<p>Though not required, DreamHost highly recommends you make the following suggested changes to your email settings to ensure a smooth email experience after your migration completes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><span id="update_email_config">Updating your email client configuration</span></h3>
<p>If you have been migrated to the mail server, your email client configuration may need to be updated.</p>
<h4><strong>New mail servers</strong></h4>
<p>In the past, your email servername (hostname) would have looked like 'sub4.mail.dreamhost.com'. Although this address will continue to work, DreamHost recommends you update your mail client settings with these new, simplified server URLs:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<p><strong>IMAP (most common)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>imap.dreamhost.com — Port 993 (incoming IMAP connections)</li>
<li>smtp.dreamhost.com — Port 465 (outgoing SMTP connections)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>POP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>pop.dreamhost.com — Port 995 (incoming POP connections)</li>
<li>smtp.dreamhost.com — Port 465 (outgoing SMTP connections)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<h4><strong>Webmail server</strong></h4>
<p>You can log into your webmail at the following address:</p>
<ul>
<li>webmail.dreamhost.com</li>
</ul>
<h3>What if I'm using external DNS?</h3>
<p>If you are using an external DNS provider, its records may need to be updated as well (including MX records).</p>
<h4><strong>MX servers</strong></h4>
<p>View the following article for instructions on how to locate your current MX records:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215035818-How-do-I-find-my-email-DNS-records-">How do I find my email DNS records?</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="vanity">Vanity mail server notice</span></h2>
<p>After your email service is migrated to the new server, any email applications still using vanity mail server URLs (such as 'mail.example.com') will experience login issues until the DNS changes have fully resolved to point to the new IP address. To work around, or avoid this altogether, DreamHost strongly recommends modifying your email application to use the updated configuration settings shown in the <a class="reference internal" href="#update_email_config">section above</a>.</p>
<p>If you choose to continue using 'mail.example.com' in your settings after DNS has finished resolving to the new IP address, your email application may show a 'SSL certificate name mismatch' error. You can find information on working around this in the following article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215306748-Certificate-domain-mismatch-error-when-connecting-to-a-DreamHost-mail-server">Certificate domain mismatch error when connecting to a DreamHost mail server</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, if you are using 'webmail.example.com' to access the webmail interface, DreamHost strongly recommends switching to <span class="code">https://webmail.dreamhost.com</span>, as this allows the secure interface to work without showing any security certificate errors in your web browser. Although <span class="code">http://webmail.example.com</span> will continue to function for the time being, DreamHost may eventually discontinue this feature.</p>
