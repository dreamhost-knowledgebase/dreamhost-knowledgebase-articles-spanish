<h2>Free trial period</h2>
<p>You are entitled to a free 14 day trial of Remixer at no cost. During your Remixer trial, you will only be able to publish your Remixer projects to a free auto-generated DreamHost Cloud URL. It will appear something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>http://911dc58e-7f21-4728-8cf9-193cfef80.remixer.website</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use this Cloud URL to stage and preview your Remixer website during the trial period.</p>
