<p><a href="https://www.wordfence.com/">Wordfence</a> is a popular security plugin for WordPress users. The plugins' default setting enables cookies, which prevents <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215300647-How-do-I-purge-the-DreamPress-cache-">Varnish</a> from being able to cache the site. As Varnish is a key factor in performance on DreamPress, it's highly recommended you disable Wordfence's ability to allow cookies.</p>
<p>The following describes how to disable cookies in the Wordfence plugin.</p>
