<p>If your domain is registered at DreamHost, you can point it to Weebly using A records:</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Once it's set to DNS only, add Weebly's DNS records. You'll need to add two A records. The following article explains how to add these records:

</dl>
</li>
<li>Add the same A record with the 'www' hostname.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once those records are saved, it make take 6 hrs or more to update online. You can check the status of your DNS changes on the following site:</p>
