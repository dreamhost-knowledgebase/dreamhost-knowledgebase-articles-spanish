<p>There are several common reasons why a website may be down. This article describes the various reasons why this occurs along with steps to resolve common issues.</p>
<h2><span id="What_do_I_do.3F">Confirm if your site is down everywhere</span></h2>
<p>The first step to take is to confirm if the site is actually down in all locations, and not just your local computer. There are a couple ways to do this.</p>
<h3><span id="Is_it_down_for_everyone.2C_or_just_me.3F">Is it down for everyone, or just me?</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/">downforeveryoneorjustme.com</a> checks if your site is online from a number of locations. It then lets you know if the site is down everywhere, or if only your computer is unable to view it.</p>
<p>If only your computer is unable to view it and you've recently updated your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS</a>, check this site to see if the new DNS has updated in your location:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.whatsmydns.net/">Global DNS Propagation Checker</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If the DNS has updated, try forcing your browser to reload the page. This clears the cache out of the browser so you see the most recent version of the page.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3><span id="Proxy_sites">Proxy sites</span></h3>
<p>Proxy sites allow you to bypass network issues and view the site from a different location. View the following article for a list of proxy sites you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216560958#Proxy_sites">Proxy sites</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If the proxy sites loads your website, it confirms the site is resolving online. If you still cannot view it, try clearing your cache and flushing DNS:</p>

<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215680477-Flush-DNS-overview">Flush DNS</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Suspended_account_due_to_non_payment">Suspended account due to non payment</span></h2>
<p>To check your account, log in to your <a href="http://panel.dreamhost.com">panel</a>. If your account is currently suspended due to non payment, a large red "SUSPENDED" notice appears at the top of the screen. To fix, click the <strong>Make Payment</strong> button to pay which re-enables your account.</p>
<p>An automated email is sent to you once the payment has been made, and then the system automatically re-enables your account. The DNS for your site must then <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215840248-DNS-propagation-overview">propagate</a> again online which may take several hours. After that, your site resolves again.</p>

<p>There is a high risk of data loss when an account is suspended. DreamHost keeps a 2-week backup of website files and 5-days worth of database records. However, DreamHost cannot guarantee that these backups are available to you. To avoid data loss, make sure to continually backup your data:</p>

<h2><span id="Expired_registration">Expired registration</span></h2>
<p>If a domain has expired, you still have 30 days to renew it. View the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215249678-How-do-I-renew-my-domain-registration-">Renewals</a> article for details on how to renew a domain name.</p>
<p>If it’s been expired for over 30 days, the domain is in its Redemption period. View the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215864937-How-do-I-redeem-my-domain-registration-">Redemption</a> article for details on how to resolve this.</p>
<p>If your domain registration is not registered at DreamHost, you must check who the registrar is through an <a href="http://whois-search.com/">online WHOIS lookup</a>. ICANN’s WHOIS search can be found here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://whois.icann.org/">ICANN WHOIS lookup</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If your status is anything other than ok, you must correct it with your domain registrar.</p>
<h2><span id="Is_my_server_up.3F">Is my server up?</span></h2>
<p>If your registration is current, and your account has not been suspended, but you can’t reach your domain even with proxy sites, check to make sure that your server is up. You can do this by running a traceroute to your server, and by pinging your domain. Instructions for performing these steps are found here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215840708-Traceroute">Traceroute</a></li>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/217141537-Collecting-ping-results">Collecting ping results</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you cannot ping the server, or complete a traceroute, please <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/218084068-Contacting-support-overview">contact support</a>. If your traceroute shows multiple hops timing out, please contact your ISP for support.</p>
<h2><span id="Are_my_files_in_the_correct_spot.3F">Are my files in the correct spot?</span></h2>
<p>Make sure that the files for your site are in the correct directory. If they are in the incorrect directory, or assigned to the wrong user, it prevents the site from loading.</p>
<p>Log in via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> or <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>, and make sure that your site files are in the correct directory. View the following article for further details:</p>

</ul>
<h2><span id="Disabled_site">Disabled site</span></h2>
<p>In rare cases, DreamHost may disable your site. Log in via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> and look at the directory name of your site. If you see the site directory has been renamed to indicate that the site has been disabled, please <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/218084068-Contacting-support-overview">contact DreamHost support</a>. In such a situation, an email is sent to you indicating what steps to take.</p>
<h2><span id="DNS_propagation">DNS propagation</span></h2>
<p>If you have made any type of <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS</a> change recently, your DNS may need more time to <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215840248-DNS-propagation-overview">propagate</a> online. This includes the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview">nameservers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215560437-What-types-of-hosting-plans-are-available-">Adding hosting</a></li>

<p>Most changes update online in 6 hours, although <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview">nameservers</a> can take up to 72 hours.

<h2>Were your processes killed on the shared server?</h2>
<p>If your site (on a Shared server) is using too many resources, your processes are automatically killed which can cause your site to go down. For more information on why this happens, please view the following article:</p>
