<h2><span id="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</span></h2>
<p>Though the web interface works upon installation, in order to be able to access and modify your files through WebDAV you must make a few changes to your .htaccess file by adding the following lines right at the end of the file:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
 RewriteEngine on
 RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization},L]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>Another issue that may come up is any domain redirects you have set up. For example, if you have Cloudflare configured for the domain that you have ownCloud installed on, you can't use the URLs that the ownCloud UI gives you for connecting to WebDAV (which are typically in the format <a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>.) Instead, you'll have to add the www. to the front of the URL.</p>
