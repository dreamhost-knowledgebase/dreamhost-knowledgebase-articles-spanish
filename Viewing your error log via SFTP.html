<li>In order to view the logs, you must log in to your server and navigate to the <code>logs/example.com/http</code> directory.</li>
<li>Logs are rotated every night so that access.log and error.log only contain today’s logs, while error.log.0 and access.log.0 contain logs from the day before.</li>
<li>Log files are deleted shortly after this, so it’s recommended to check them as soon as possible.</li>
