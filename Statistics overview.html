<p>All DreamHost accounts have the ability to add site statistics to any fully hosted website. The stat service tracks the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>total number of requests</li>
<li>traffic by domain</li>
<li>traffic by file</li>
<li>requests by browser type</li>
<li>requests by operating system</li>
<li>requests by referring URLs</li>
<li>and more!</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Adding_a_stats_user">Adding a stats user</span></h2>
<p>Before your site can begin logging statistics, you must first create a stats user. Visit the following article for further details:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216510258-Panel-statistics-overview">Accessing Stats</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Where_can_I_view_my_stats.3F">Where can I view my stats?</span></h2>
<p>To view your statistics report:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visit your domain name followed by /stats. For example, if your site is titled ‘example.com’, visit ‘example.com/stats’ which opens up a login prompt.</li>
<li>Enter a username and password when prompted. The credentials are the username and password you created for the stats user.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re using a CMS such as WordPress, you may need to add additional code to your site's .htaccess file in order to access the /stats login page.</p>
<p>View the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/217068087-Making-stats-accessible-with-an-htaccess-file">making stats accessible with htaccess</a> article for further information.</p>

<h2><span id="Explanation_of_results">Explanation of results</span></h2>
<p>Most of the results you see in your reports are broken down by date, #reqs, and #pages:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>#reqs</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents the number of files that are requested during a page request. When a single page is requested, all content on that page is also requested. If a page has 25 images, a single page visit triggers 26 requests: 25 requests for the images and 1 request for the page.</dd>
<dt><strong>#pages</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents the entire page request, not the individual files within it. In the #reqs example above, the #pages value is 1 since only that single page is requested. If your stats show 10 visitors and 40 page views, this means each visitor viewed 4 pages on average. More page views per visitor means people are staying on your site longer and viewing more content.</dd>
</dl>

<h2><span id="Viewing_the_raw_log_files">Viewing the raw log files</span></h2>
<p>If you need to review the raw log files for your stats rather than a statistics report, you can view them by logging into your web server. In your home directory, there is a folder named /logs.</p>
<p>View the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216512197-Viewing-your-error-log-via-SFTP">error log</a> article for instructions on how to access this folder.</p>
<p>You can then find your stat logs in the following directories:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">/home/username/logs/example.com/http/analog/
/home/username/logs/example.com/http/hits
/home/username/logs/example.com/http/html
</pre>
</div>
<h2><span id="How_and_when_are_site_usage_stats_generated.3F">How and when are site usage stats generated?</span></h2>
<p>Stats are generated once a day early in the morning, which analyzes logs from the previous day. Stats for a given day should be available by noon of the next day, Pacific Time.</p>
