<p>An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a unique number assigned to every device on the Internet. This guide briefly covers what IP addresses do and provides more information on managing IP addresses at DreamHost.</p>

<h2><span id="What_are_IP_addresses.3F_What_do_they_do.3F">What are IP addresses? What do they do?</span></h2>
<p>Like a telephone number or street address, an IP address identifies networked devices and defines their location on a network like the Internet. There are currently two IP address versions</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IPv4</strong> – The older protocol which is limited to the number of devices it can support.</li>
<li><strong>IPv6</strong> – The newer replacement which supports significantly more devices and has been adopted over the last 10 years.</li>
</ul>
<p>DreamHost provides both IP address versions and automatically assigns an IPv4 address to all active servers, services, and domains.</p>
<p>An IP address can be shared by multiple domains without issue. If necessary, a single <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216109647-Unique-IP-overview">Unique IP</a> address can be assigned to any fully hosted domain using the DreamHost panel. A domain can also have multiple IP addresses assigned to its domain name system (DNS) records.</p>
<p>In the same way that an IP address is similar to a telephone number or street address, DNS is like a map or a phone book. It resolves easy to use domain names to the IP address to which they are assigned. IP addresses assigned to a domain can be changed either manually by you or automatically by DreamHost as a result of a server change.</p>
<h2><span id="Internet_Protocol_versions">Internet Protocol versions</span></h2>
<p>There are two internetwork layer protocols in use by the Internet and supported by DreamHost:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>IPv4</strong></dt>
<dd>The most widely-deployed protocol, limited to 32-bit (4-byte) addresses normally expressed as 4 groups of decimal digits (e.g., <code>192.0.2.235</code>). IPv4 allows for roughly 4.3 billion addresses and as the number of devices connected to the Internet increases, this limit is being reached. Assigning a Unique IPv4 address at DreamHost incurs an additional monthly cost due to the limited availability of IPv4 addresses.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216510458-IPv6"><strong>IPv6</strong></a></dt>
<dd>A new protocol with a 128-bit addressing scheme normally expressed as 8 groups of hexadecimal digits (e.g., <code>2001:0db8:85a3:08d3:1319:8a2e:0370:7334</code>). IPv6 was created to manage the growth of the Internet and allows for roughly 3.4×1038 addresses. DreamHost currently offers free Unique IPv6 addresses.</dd>

<p>In some circumstances, it may be useful or necessary to add a Unique IP address to a DreamHost-hosted domain. For example, a Unique IP address is required in order to add <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215464967-Anonymous-FTP-overview">Anonymous FTP</a> to a domain.

<p>If you need to find your website’s IP address that DreamHost has assigned, you can view it in your panel. Visit the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DreamHost DNS</a> article for further instructions.</p>
<p>To view the IP address your domain is resolving to online, you can use an online tool such as this:</p>
