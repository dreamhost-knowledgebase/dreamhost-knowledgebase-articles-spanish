<div id="what-is-private-networking">
<p>Private networking is a type of network in which all the instances connected to that network are able to talk to each other and reach the rest of the Internet through a router, but the rest of the Internet cannot initialize a connection to those instances.</p>
<p>Private networking is ideal for running services you wish to make secure, as these services are unreachable from the Internet and thus are much harder to compromise.</p>
<div id="enabling-private-networking">
<h2>Enabling private networking</h2>
<p>Currently, the only way to enable private networking on your US-East 2 account is to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/218084068-Contacting-support-overview">contact support</a> and request that it be enabled.</p>
<div id="price">
<h2>Price</h2>
<p>Private networking in US-East 2 is currently free of charge during its beta trial period. US-East 2 accounts also come with one floating IP address (this allows you to attach a publicly accessible IPv4 address to an instance on the private network). If additional addresses are required, they are charged at $1/month per floating IP.</p>

<div id="known-issues">
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<p>Private networking is currently a beta feature, but has been well tested. One limitation currently in place is that IPv6 is not supported with private networking.</p>
<p>Private networking cannot be added to existing instances. This is because, much like the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001736691-How-to-create-a-Key-pair-overview">Key pair</a>, the networking configuration is hard-coded into the instance during the creation process.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Once support has enabled private networking on your account, please refer to one of the following articles to setup a functional private network that instances can be attached to during the creation process.</p>
