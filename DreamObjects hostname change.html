<p>The following is a historical post from November 2016, visible from the Panel, for users of the old DreamObjects hostname. DreamHost is posting this article in case anyone missed updating some configuration in an infrequently used tool. The hostname remained operational, but officially unsupported until late 2017.</p>

<p>As part of ongoing service improvements, DreamHost is making a subtle, but critical, change to how you access DreamObjects. Specifically, it is changing the DreamObjects hostname to prepare for upcoming enhancements.</p>
<h2>What's changing?</h2>
<p>Anywhere that you use the old DreamObjects hostname, you must change your configurations just slightly and replace it with the new hostname before January 9th, 2017:</p>
<ul>
<li>Old hostname: <strong>objects.dreamhost.com</strong></li>
<li>New hostname: <strong>objects-us-west-1.dream.io</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This new hostname is already active and available for use in parallel with the old name. Your bucket names and keypairs remain the same and your data will not be modified in any way. DNS entries inside the DreamHost panel have already been updated.</p>
<h2>Where can I find more information?</h2>
<p>For information about needed software updates, please see the following knowledge base article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/218339127-What-Applications-Are-Compatible-With-DreamObjects">What applications are compatible with DreamObjects?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>DreamHost's support documentation has been updated and covers most software with detailed examples of how to set the configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/categories/202115428-DreamObjects-Cloud-Storage">DreamObjects Cloud Storage</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The old hostname will be discontinued not sooner than January 9th, 2017, but DreamHost strongly advises that you update your configuration at your earliest convenience.</p>
