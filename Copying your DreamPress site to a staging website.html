<p>This article describes how to copy your primary DreamPress site to a staging website. The staging site allows you to test changes you plan on making on your live site while your live site remains up and running normally.</p>
<p>When you're finished working on your staging site and have it configured the way you like, you can then import those changes back into your live website.</p>
<h2>Creating a staging website</h2>
<p>View the following article to add a DreamPress to a temporary domain.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/115002837508-Creating-a-DreamPress-temporary-domain">Creating a DreamPress temporary domain</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This site can be named anything, but it's recommended you use your domain name followed by dream.press. For example, if your site is 'example.com', create a temporary site named 'example.dream.press'.</p>
<p>After this temporary DreamPress site is created, you'll receive an email with your new username and a link to create a password. You can then log in at example.dream.press/wp-admin.</p>
<h2>Copying your live site to the staging site</h2>
<p>These steps copy your live DreamPress website to your staging website. You can then test and work on the staging site without affecting the live site.</p>

<li>Navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=dreampress.dashboard&amp;">Panel &gt; 'DreamPress' &gt; 'Dashboard'</a>) page.

<p>You can also use a site on a Shared web server to stage your changes. For the site to show in the list, the WordPress site on the Shared server must have been set up using the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215915837-How-do-I-install-a-One-Click-Install-">One-Click Installer</a>.</p>

</ol>
<p>Once your website is finished copying to your staging site, an email confirmation is sent to you.</p>
<h2>Making sure your staging site has an SSL certificate</h2>
<p>It's important to protect your password login in the next step. The following helps you determine if you need to manually add an SSL certificate to your domain.</p>
<h3>If your staging site you're copying to is on a DreamPress plan</h3>
<p>You can view a list of your DreamPress domains on the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=dreampress.dashboard&amp;">Panel &gt; 'DreamPress' &gt; 'Dashboard'</a>) page. If you are copying from your primary DreamPress site to a staging site on the DreamPress platform, an SSL certificate is automatically generated for you, so there's nothing you need to do.</p>
<h3>If your staging site you're copying to is on a Shared plan</h3>
<p>If you're copying to a staging site on Shared hosting, the website does not automatically have an SSL certificate generated for it. In this case, visit the following article to add a free 'Let's Encrypt' certificate to the new staging domain.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Password-protecting your site</h2>
<p>Because a staging site is exact copy of your live site, it's possible it may diminish the SEO ranking of your live site. To prevent this, DreamHost recommends that you password-protect your staging site.</p>
