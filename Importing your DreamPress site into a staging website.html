<p>If you want to adjust the look, feel, or functionality of your DreamPress site, the best option is to create a separate 'staging' website.</p>
<p>A 'staging' site can be added as a second DreamPress site on the 'Advanced' plan. You can then import your live site into this 'staging' site and make changes. When finished, simply import the changes back into your live website.</p>
<p>The following article describes the necessary steps to create and use this type of 'staging' website.</p>
<h2>Step 1 — Create a staging website</h2>
<p>View the following article to add a DreamPress temporary domain.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/115002837508-Creating-a-DreamPress-temporary-domain">Creating a DreamPress temporary domain</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This site can be named anything, but it's recommended you use your domain name followed by dream.press. For example, if your site is 'example.com', create a temporary site named 'example.dream.press'.</p>
<p>After it's created, you'll receive an email with your new username and a link to create a password. You can then log in at example.dream.press/wp-admin.</p>
<h2>Step 2 — Import your live site into the staging website</h2>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=dreampress.dashboard&amp;">Panel &gt; 'DreamPress' &gt; 'Dashboard'</a>) page.

</dl>
</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Manage</strong> button to the right of your staging domain.
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/2018-05_panel_dreampress_importing_your_site_01.png" alt="" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Towards the bottom, click the 'Domain' tab.</li>
<li>To the right, click 'Import existing site'.
<dl>
<dd><em>A pop-up displays where you can select your current live DreamPress site.</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Start Import</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<p>The migration generally happens quickly (depending on how much data there is to import). When finished, you'll receive a confirmation email to the primary address listed on your DreamHost account.</p>
<p>If you visit your staging site now, it appears the same as your live DreamPress website.</p>
<div class="alert alert-important">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-important-icon.svg" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>Once you proceed with this step, it's recommended that you do NOT make any further changes to your live site since Step#4 below will overwrite any changes you've made.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Step 3 — Make changes to your staging site</h2>
<p>Log into your staging website. The URL appears similar to this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>example.dream.press/wp-admin</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Once logged in, make any necessary changes and then est your site to confirm it's working as intended with these new changes. Once your site functions and appears exactly as you would like the public to view it, proceed to the next step to import these changes back into your current live website.</p>
<h2>Step 4 — Import the staging site into your live DreamPress site</h2>
<div class="alert alert-important">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-important-icon.svg" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>Copying your staging site changes to your live site will overwrite any changes you have made after exporting in step#2 above. </p>
<p>If you have made changes to your live site during this process, it may be easier to continue to update your live site with the changes you've already tested on your staging site, rather than importing content from the staging site.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is the same as Step#2 above, except you reverse the domain names. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=dreampress.dashboard&amp;">Panel &gt; 'DreamPress' &gt; 'Dashboard'</a>) page.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Manage</strong> button to the right of your <strong>LIVE</strong> domain.
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/2018-05_panel_dreampress_importing_your_site_01.png" alt="" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Towards the bottom, click the 'Domain' tab.</li>
<li>To the right, click 'Import existing site'.
<dl>
<dd><em>A pop-up displays where you can select your <strong>STAGING</strong> DreamPress site.</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Start Import</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<p>After the import is complete, your live site will be updated with the changes you made to your staging website.</p>
