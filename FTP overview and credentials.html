<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a network protocol that is commonly used to transfer website data from your local computer to the remote web server. This allows you to develop a website locally (on your computer) and then upload it to the remote server to be published to your website.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>This article uses the FTP client '<a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">Filezilla</a>' to illustrate examples. You can use <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215613107-List-of-FTP-client-software">any client you like</a> to log into your server, as the settings are the same.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Once you're connected and have uploaded your files, you can use the following article to create and edit files within Filezilla.</p>

<h2>Locating your FTP login credentials</h2>
<p>You will need the following information to log into your web server:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#Finding_your_FTP_server_hostname">FTP Server/Hostname</a></li>
<li><a href="#Locating_the_correct_FTP_user">FTP Username</a></li>

<h2><span id="Choosing_the_FTP_port">Choosing the FTP port</span></h2>
<p>To connect, use the following port number setting for your type of user :</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>FTP user</strong></dt>
<dd>connect with port number <strong>21 (NOT RECOMMENDED)</strong></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>SFTP or SHELL user</strong> </dt>
<dd>connect with port number <strong>22</strong></dd>
</dl>
<p>You can check if your user is an FTP/SFTP/SHELL user in your panel at (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=users.users&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Users’ &gt; ‘Manage Users’</a>).</p>
<div class="alert alert-important">

<div class="alert-content">
<p>It is highly recommended that you use port 22 with an SFTP or Shell user as it helps to ensure your data is safe when connecting. View the '<a href="#Setting_an_existing_user_to_SFTP">Security</a>' section below for details on how to change your FTP user to an SFTP user.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here's an example using Filezilla using port 22:</p>

<h2>Where do I put my files?</h2>
<p>Once you're logged in you'll see several files and folders. View the following article for instructions on where to upload your site files:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214920778-Where-do-I-put-my-files-once-connected-via-FTP-">Where do I upload my site files?</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="FTP_security">FTP security</span></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, FTP (port 21) is not considered a "secure" protocol. This means that incoming/outgoing data is unencrypted and in plain text. Because the data is unencrypted, an exceptionally sneaky person could eavesdrop on what you're sending.</p>
<p>For this reason, it's only recommended that you create an <a href="#Setting_an_existing_user_to_SFTP">SFTP</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385837-Enabling-Shell-access">Shell</a> user and use port 22 when connecting.</p>
<h3><span id="Difference_between_FTP_and_SFTP">Difference between FTP and SFTP</span></h3>
<p>SFTP is a network protocol designed to provide secure file transfer over the secure shell (<a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>) protocol. SFTP is NOT just FTP run over SSH, but rather a new protocol. It is often called Secure FTP because it uses an encrypted transport layer.</p>
<h3><span id="Setting_an_existing_user_to_SFTP">Setting an existing FTP user to an SFTP user</span></h3>
<p>Navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=users.users&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Users' &gt; 'Manage Users'</a>) page. To the right of your username, you'll see if its an FTP, SFTP, or Shell user:</p>
<img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/Change_FTP_user.png" alt="Change FTP user" />
<ul>
<li>Click the '<strong>Edit</strong>' button to the right of the user.</li>
 </ul>
<img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/Change_FTP_user2.png" alt="Change FTP user" />
<ul>
<li>Choose the radio button for 'SFTP user', then click the '<strong>Save Changes</strong>' button.</li>
<li>Wait about 20 min for the new settings to update. You can then log into your server using port 22.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="Creating_an_SFTP_user_when_editing_domain">Creating an SFTP user when editing a domain</span></h3>
<p>When you are editing or adding a new domain and add a new user during that process, it defaults to SFTP automatically and FTP is disallowed.</p>
<p>If you need FTP for some reason, you still have the option to uncheck the box 'Disallow FTP?' for the newly created user, but this is <strong>NOT RECOMMENDED</strong>. You can do that on the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=users.users&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Users’ &gt; ‘Manage Users’</a>) page by editing the user:</p>
<img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/01_FTP_User.fw.png" alt="01 FTP User.fw.png" />
<h3><span id="Disable_FTP">Disabling FTP on a VPS server</span></h3>
<p>If you have a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-overview-VPS-">VPS</a>, you can completely disable FTP to further secure your server. Navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=vps.dashboard&amp;">Panel &gt; 'VPS' &gt; 'Dashboard'</a>) page:</p>
<img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/Disable_FTP.png" alt="Disable FTP" />
<p>To the right of the server, click the '<strong>Configure</strong>' button. Click the dropdown to the right of 'FTP server' and select 'Inactive'. Finally, click '<strong>Save ps123456's settings</strong>' at the bottom to save.</p>
<h3><span id="Notes_on_using_SFTP">Notes on using SFTP</span></h3>
<p>When logging in to your account using SFTP you may notice some differences from what you would normally see when you logged in with a normal FTP user.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to ensure that a particular user's home directory cannot be accessed by other users (even those in your same group) you can enable the "<a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215282088-How-do-I-set-up-Enhanced-User-Security-">Enhanced security?</a>" option for that user.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You may notice that you can also access other directories above the <span class="code">/home</span> directory. That's normal, as all users have some level of access to those directories. However, as a regular user you won't be able to view files that you don't have access to, nor are you able to harm the server. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span id="hidden_files">Hidden files/directories</span></strong>: On a Unix system, hidden files are those that begin with a period (.) in their name. As with FTP clients, SFTP clients usually have an option to "enable/disable viewing hidden files". If that is enabled, you'll be able to see these files/directories (if your user has permissions to do so). If you are having problems deleting a directory (assuming you have the correct permissions to delete) and it gives you an error saying "directory not empty", it may be that there are hidden files/directories in that directory that your client is not allowing you to see. Check your program options before going any further. If you do have the option enabled to view hidden files/directories and still cannot delete a directory, please contact support for assistance. Give support the server, user account, and full path to the directory you are trying to delete so they can investigate. View the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215613037-How-do-I-show-hidden-files-on-my-FTP-client-">How do I show hidden files?</a> article for further information.</li>

<h2><span id="host_key_is_unknown">Warning: The server's host key is unknown</span></h2>
<p>When you originally log into a DreamHost server, you may see the following warning:</p>
