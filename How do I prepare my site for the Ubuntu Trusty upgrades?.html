<p>The following provides information to help you prepare your site for the Ubuntu upgrade to version 14.04.5 LTS (aka Trusty Tahr).</p>
<h2>What to expect</h2>
<p>DreamHost's team will contact you via email in advance of the upgrade. A notice will also be visible in the <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi">DreamHost Control Panel</a> during the upgrade process.</p>
<p>The time frame of an upgrade can vary from server to server, however the timing ensures that there are several highly trained engineers on hand should any major issues arise. The upgrade itself should take no longer than an hour to complete.</p>
<p>To date in 2018, DreamHost has completed upgrades on its Shared and VPS web servers. New users on all web servers will also be using Trusty by default (Shared, VPS, DreamPress, and Dedicated). DreamHost is now beginning the process of rolling out upgrades for its Shared MySQL servers.</p>
<p>Any services that rely on the availability of your MySQL server (WordPress or any other database-driven websites, applications, and so on) will not be reachable until the upgrade is complete. This will NOT affect cloud or email services.</p>
