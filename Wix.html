<p>There are two options to point your DNS to Wix:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.wix.com/en/article/tutorial-connecting-your-domain-using-name-servers">Pointing your nameservers</a> (Recommended)</li>
<li><a href="https://support.wix.com/en/article/tutorial-connecting-your-domain-by-pointing-to-ip">Pointing A records</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The best option is to point your nameservers to Wix. Pointing nameservers is recommended as Wix will then control all of your DNS records including email. If you want to only host your site at Wix and continue hosting email at DreamHost, you must point A records instead.</p>
