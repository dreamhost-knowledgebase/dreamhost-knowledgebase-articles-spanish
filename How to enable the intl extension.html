<p>The <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.intl.php">intl extension</a> is compiled in PHP, but it's not enabled by default. To enable it, you just need to make a small addition to your phprc file.</p>
<h2>The DreamHost phprc file</h2>
<p>The standard term for a PHP configuration file is <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214200688-php-ini-overview">php.ini</a>. However, DreamHost uses the term "phprc" file instead. This acts the same way â€“ only the name is different. In this article, only the term phprc is used.</p>

<h2>Enabling the intl extension</h2>
<p>Add the following line to your phprc file.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">extension=intl.so</pre>
</div>
<h2>Kill off all running php processes</h2>
<p>Make sure to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214200748-My-phprc-file-isn-t-updating">kill running php processes</a> to ensure your new settings take effect.</p>
<h2>Confirming your changes</h2>
<p>After you've edited the file and killed off all PHP processes, check to confirm the extension has been enabled. You can do this by creating a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214895287-How-do-I-view-my-PHP-environment-settings-">phpinfo.php file</a>. You should see the following:</p>

</dl>
<p>If you do not see your changes have updated, try killing off your PHP processes again:</p>
