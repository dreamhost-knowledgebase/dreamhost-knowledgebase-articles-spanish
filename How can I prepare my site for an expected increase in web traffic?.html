<p>If you're expecting a significant increase in web traffic, you probably have a few questions on how to optimize your website to achieve optimal performance. The following provides answers to some of these questions.</p>
<p>You might also want to send a message to <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/218084068-Contacting-support-overview">support</a> and let them know that you expect increased web traffic so they can keep an eye on it.</p>
<h2><span id="Keep_your_software_up_to_date">Keep your software up to date</span></h2>
<p>Make sure that your <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215302687#Keep_software_up_to_date">applications are up to date</a>. For example, if you’re running a WordPress site, make sure the following are updated:</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress version</li>
<li>Plugin versions</li>
<li>Theme version</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using a DreamHost One-Click Install, you can update the software version in the panel. Visit the following article for further details:</p>

</ul>
<h2><span id="Enable_caching">Enable caching</span></h2>
<p>If your site provides dynamic content or is database driven (i.e., WordPress, Joomla, ZenCart, MediaWiki, phpBB, WebCalendar, and so on), you may want to enable some form of "caching" add-on. See that particular application's support page for further details and suggestions. If you’re running a WordPress site, review the following article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214586538-WordPress-caching-options">WordPress caching</a></li>

</ul>
<h2><span id="Disable_unused_software">Disable unused software</span></h2>
<p>Disable unnecessary, unreliable, or resource intensive plug-ins if possible. If you’re running a WordPress site, disable any unused themes, plugins, or extra WordPress installations. Visit the following article for further details:</p>

</ul>
<h2><span id="Prevent_spam">Prevent spam</span></h2>
<p>If your site allows visitors to leave comments, please make sure you're using some type of plugin to prevent spam comments. For example, if you're using WordPress, <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215300907-WordPress-SPAM-plugins">Akismet</a> is a good choice.</p>
<h2><span id="Secure_contact_forms">Secure contact forms</span></h2>
<p>Make sure that your "contact us" form scripts are not vulnerable to abuse by spammers.</p>
<h2><span id="Optimize_media_files">Optimize media files</span></h2>
<p>You may want to replace large graphics, files, movies, and so on with lower resolution (smaller) versions temporarily.</p>

<h2><span id="Convert_dynamic_content_to_static_content">Convert dynamic content to static content</span></h2>
<p>If you can convert dynamic pages to static pages, that would help tremendously (but it may be difficult to do). Some caching tools, such as <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214588698-Installing-WP-Super-Cache">wp-super-cache</a>, include the ability to do this using the plugin.</p>
<h2><span id="Keep_track_of_your_CPU_minutes">Keep track of your CPU minutes</span></h2>

<h2><span id="Throttle_or_disable_your_site">Throttle or disable your site</span></h2>
<p>If for whatever reason your increased traffic causes problems for the server, it may be necessary for support to "throttle" your site (restricting the number of simultaneous visitors or maximum throughput, or the like) or possibly even disable it. This is done in fairness to the other customers on your server.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>Remember that you're on a shared hosting plan and one customer cannot jeopardize the operation of the server for all of the other customers. DreamHost support offers optimization suggestions to help your site remain up and running, however it’s ultimately your responsibility to make sure your site does not negatively affect other users.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If it is necessary to throttle your site for some reason, support will contact the owner of the account with the details. If there is a problem with your site that you can resolve, make sure to notify support with details of what you did to fix the problem. Then, support may remove the throttle in place.</p>
<h2><span id="Upgrade_options">Upgrade options</span></h2>
<p>If it’s not possible to optimize your site any further, it may be necessary to upgrade your hosting plan to a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-overview-VPS-">VPS</a> (Virtual Private Server). This is a separate hosting plan on a private server which gives you your own ‘virtual machine’. The VPS plan allows you to allocate the amount of RAM necessary to run your site. Even in the case of a spike in traffic, your site will not affect other users on the server.</p>
