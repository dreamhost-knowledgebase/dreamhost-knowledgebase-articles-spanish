<p>DreamHost offers the ability to create many different types of users, each of which are necessary for different tasks within the panel as well as interacting with your site.</p>
<p>Each user has its own unique password that is independent of other users. This article details how to change the passwords for each type of user in your DreamHost account.</p>

<h2><span id="Password_guidelines">Password guidelines</span></h2>
<p>There are a few things you should always consider when creating a password. These will help to protect your user from being compromised as well as protect other users in the case of an intrusion:</p>
<ol>
<li>Never use your username as your password, or even a portion of it.</li>
<li>Never use personal information such as your name, phone number, address, anniversary, birthday, pet's name, DOB, license plate, etc.</li>
<li>The longer the password, the better. It's recommended it should be at least 8 characters.</li>
<li>Never use the same password twice. Always change to something new.</li>
<li>Combine letters, numbers and special characters to make your password harder to guess.</li>
<li>Mix upper and lower case letters to increase security.</li>
<li>Do not use common words that can be guessed such as ‘guest’ or ‘password’ or any variations of those words.</li>
<li>Enable <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216013897-Multifactor-Authentication-overview">Multifactor Authentication</a> when possible.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You can also use an online website to help create a password. An example would be <a href="http://passwordsgenerator.net/">passwordgenerator</a>.</li>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>Most important, do not share your password with anyone. If someone requires access to your account, try alternate options such as creating a new user for them or giving them panel access through <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413677-Account-privileges-overview">Account Privileges</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>The max password length is 31 characters.</p>
<p>You can add special characters. The only characters that are not allowed are single and double quotes.</p>
<h2><span id="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</span></h2>
<p>It's possible that after resetting a password within your panel, you find it's not working, or the old password still functions. This is commonly due to two issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not enough time has passed since changing the password. Allow up to 30 minutes for your password to update online.</li>
<li>Your old password is cached. You may need to clear your web browser’s cache if you find the old password for your user is still being cached upon logging in. If the new password does not work after 30 minutes of changing it, try clearing your web browser cache and then try again:
